# Progress OpenerPCR october 2014

It appeared we broke another Peltier element again (it is used for heating and cooling). It is known to be a fragile part, but that it already breaks by falling two centimeters was still unexpected. A new part was bought and tested. Only a couple of seconds connection to an ATX was enough to be sure it works.

The OpenerPCR needs to have two modules to be added to the main board: an inverter and a relay board. Richel tried to etch these PCBs three times and failed thrice. For Winand, however, this is a piece of cake. The probable error Richel makes is that he lets the PCB hang in the blue cupperpersulphate bath for too long. 

Next to this, their has been made some improvements on the front of the casing: the debugging LEDs of the H bridge are in place, together with some explanatory grooves. These grooves can still be improved though in their aesthetics.
