# Proposed course setup

This proposed course setup is very similar to the Arduino course setup, only the focus is different. The Arduino course is evaluated by the students to be both gezellig and a place to learn effectively.

For this to work, the course must take place on Fridays, 19:00-22:00, the same time as the Arduino course.

This proposed course setup is chosen to deal with the irregularity of DIYbio's being present. In the worst-case scenario, Peter and Richel have to be able to supervise two courses at the same time, so it gives a steady base. Starting from this base, the rest of the DIYbio's can spice it up and reap the glory :-) . 

## Course goal

To bring more advanced biology expriments within reach of everybody.

To reach this goal, we need to:
 * talk about diverse topics in biology
 * build setups for simple experiments, like a mealworm farm, hydrophonics, etc.
 * build machines for more advanced research techniques, like a PCR machine, gel electrophoresis, centrifuge
 * develop skills to do so:
   * biology: growing organisms, lab work, theoretical work
   * design: 2D/3D CAD programs, electronic schematics
   * construction: working metal, working wood, 3D printing, laser-cutting
   * control: electronics and Arduino programming

## Course mindset

 * A student is always welcome to join
 * A student can be of any age
 * A student can have any skill level
 * A student choses his/her projects

## Course form

At the very least, the course facilitates a learning environment.

The course has two aspects:
  * Explore: a single-evening presentation or workshop, exploring diverse biology themes
  * Exploit: a longer term project, focus on a single biology aspect 

The backbone of the course is to work in small project groups (2-5 people). Students choose a project to work on. Teachers couple the students' needs to people with the right skills.

Additionally, teachers can plan a presentation and/or workshop when he/she has the time to.

## Course timeline

 * Summer holiday
   * building up lab
   * doing some simple experiments
   * gather ideas
   * make a schedule 
 * First year
   * perform experiments with only simple preparation
   * build machines for more advanced experiments (e.g. PCR, elctrop
   * build a community of teachers and students, each with their own skills 
   * develop basic skills like biology (growing plants/insects)  2D/3D design, construction (metal, wood, 3D printing), Arduino (electronics, programming)
 * Second year
   * perform advanced experiments
   * ...


## Example course topics

  * How to observe through a microscope
  * What is the anatomy of [an organism] and how to dissect it
  * How to grow insects
  * How to cook with insects
  * How to grow plants in a window
  * Design a casing in Sketchup and laser-cut it
  * Design an object in Sketchup and 3D print it
  * The use of a PCR reaction
  * How to select a primer for a PCR reaction
  * How does taste work and how to hack it
  * How to let an Arduino do measurements
  * How to paint with bacteria

## Example course projects

  * OpenerPCR
  * Electrophoresis tray
  * Centrifuge
  * Bat detector
  * Mealworm farm
  * Ant farm
  * Hydroponics

But hey, the students probably have ideas themselves as well
